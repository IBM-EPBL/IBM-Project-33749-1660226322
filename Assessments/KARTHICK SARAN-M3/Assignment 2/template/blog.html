          I got an opportunity to visit New Delhi from Chennai by flight on Oct
          04th, 2015. This was my first flight experience which was paid by my
          company, you can understand my happiness level..:) :) :) We reached
          the airport at 12:30 PM. After some formal chit chat I went for the
          security check. My Etihad Jet Airways flight 9W 740 was scheduled to
          leave at 01:40 PM. The flight was on time and I had the window seat so
          I was so happy .I was ready and waiting for the take off.Before take
          off pilot was introducing himself and wish us a happy journey then
          after air hostess tell us about safety rules. Both introductory
          session was in Hindi and English So it was easy to understandable.Now
          time came... Firstly the plane went on the run way till the opposite
          end and all the while i was feeling as if i am sitting in a bus. But
          finally it took an about-turn and the speed increased exponentially.
          Within a few seconds I was high, up in the sky. The view was
          breath-taking.The roads,building,fields everything seemed like
          lines,toys.The actual city looked like a toy model of a city. My ears
          were humming initially when the plane increased the height, but later
          on everything was fine.Time just flew and very soon like approx 30 min
          meals was provided by air hostess with a simple pleasant smile.lunch
          was quite good and tasty.Finally I reached Delhi before time at 3:45
          PM.The Delhi airport is really eye catching and awesome. A bus dropped
          us till the airport. So many planes were lined up there. It was one of
          the most memorable experience of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!

          Indrani Ghose has been blogging for almost ten years. In that time
          she’s been capturing the heart of India with an array of photography,
          particularly stunning portraits and faces of India. Proudly patriotic,
          no stone is left untouched, whether it is a review of the latest
          Indian automobile, ghostly tales in haunted Indian palaces, or
          delicious destination dining. Ghose has since expanded the blog to
          global travels – having travelled to over 19 countries and 225 cities.
          You might be surprised to learn that Ghose was also a trained engineer
          in the Indian Air Force before venturing into the freelance writing
          world. Isharethese.com is also THE blog where you will see British
          Prime Minister Theresa May dressed in a full-blown sari during her
          recent India visit
